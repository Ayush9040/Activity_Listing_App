# Assets Folder

This folder should contain the following image assets for the Expo app:

## Required Assets

1. **icon.png** - App icon (1024x1024 px)
   - Used for app icon on devices

2. **splash.png** - Splash screen image (1284x2778 px for iOS)
   - Displayed while app is loading

3. **adaptive-icon.png** - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024 px)
   - Used for Android app icon with adaptive shapes

4. **favicon.png** - Web favicon (48x48 px)
   - Used for web browser tab icon

## Note

For development purposes, you can use placeholder images or Expo's default assets. The app will work without these files during development, though you may see warnings.

To generate these assets automatically, you can:
1. Use online tools like https://makeappicon.com/
2. Use Figma or other design tools
3. Use Expo's asset generation features

For production, ensure all assets meet the size requirements and follow platform guidelines.
